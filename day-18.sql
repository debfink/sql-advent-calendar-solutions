-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
  quiz_date, 
  subject, 
  score,
  first_value(score) over (
    partition by subject
    order by quiz_date
  ) as first_score,
  last_value(score) over (
    partition by subject
    ORDER BY quiz_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) as last_score
FROM
  daily_quiz_scores
